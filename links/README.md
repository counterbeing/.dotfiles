# Links

Any file in this directory ending in `.link` will have a symbolic link created
to it in the home dir, the `.link` extension removed, and a `.` prepended to the
name.

Don't worry, this won't delete anything, but it will move dotfiles you already
have with the same name, and append `_backup_date` to the name.

Once you start editing these files, you'll actually be editing them here in the
repo, which is why, if you're not me, you might want to fork this project, so
that you can use it to sync the changes between machines.
